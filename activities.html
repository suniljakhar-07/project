<h2>1. Paddy cultivation</h2> 
<pre>
After land preparation we had transplanted PR-121 Paddy on 30th June,2020. The crop was harvested <br>
on 10th October,2020 and yield was 24Quintal per acre. This is the first crop harvested organically.<br>
For land preparation, we used cow dung manure and waste decomposer. Among the manures, we used <br>
Blue-green Algae and two times liquid goat manure prepared by using waste decomposer. Twice, we used <br>
Sagarika as growth promoter and occasionally NPK bacteria is used. Now, we are in the position <br>
to supply organic rice, both polish and unpolished in lower rate.</pre>

<h2>2. Banana cultivation</h2>
<pre>
Our main emphasis is on horticulture and the initiative is started by planting Banana Grand Naine<br>
variety on 21st July, 2020 for a acre of land. We have to face a lot of constrain for this crop, <br>
as the climatic condition is not much suited for it. But, our efforts is going on and gradually <br>
situation is improving. It is completely organic and without any artificial support such as crop <br>
cover, poly house etc. As it took more time for fruiting and proper growth, we had experimented <br>
inter cropping and it was successful. We had tried for  Moong, Lobia and Maize in the month of <br>
August-September, and successfully get good yield. We had used cowdung, goat and poultry manures <br>
only. As maize is very much prone to pest, we used Neem oil and herbal self made pesticides, <br>
and the result was excellent. Before, the onset of Winter, banana were is good conditions, but, <br>
harsh winter had definitely impact  and indication of frost is noticed and growth were almost <br>
seized. But, now (26th Januaruy,2021), it is gradually improving. We had also tried Cauliflower <br>
as inter crop, and we are happy to share that bumper yield is noticed. But, unfortunately, <br>
we are not able to sell it due to very less price. But, it was a blessing for us, fed to our <br>
goat and even poultry. The major crop i.e. Banana took more than a year’s span for fruiting, <br>
hence, we are expecting it  to come by the month of August onwards.

<h2>5. Black Gram</h2>

Besides, Pea, we had also sown black gram, but due to profuse growth of weeds, it is not<br>
doing well. We are started weeding and soon, it will take the pace of growth.<br>
Besides, a number of crop is tried and we are getting satisfactory results, like<br> 
Onion, Radish, Brocolli, Carrot, Fava bean (Bakla).

<h2>8. Papaya</h2>

health benefit, it is our moral responsibility to provide this crop and also to <br>
popularize among the people of this regions.

<h2>GOAT FARMING</h2>
<pre>
Eleven goats were brought to our farm on 16th August,2020 and our goat farming started.<br>
We are not able to provide organic feed initially, but, gradually providing organic <br>
green fodder from 10th September onward. The grain is not completely organic. Hence,<br> 
we are providing semi organic feed at this moment. Within 3-4 month, we can provide <br>
organic feed only to our goat. On  6th September, nine goats were also added to our <br>
farm. We are even, not feeding them antibiotic also. Sixteen kids birth took place <br>
and due to harsh climatic condition, only nine kids survived and now they are in <br>
good conditions. Our aim of goat farming is to produce hormone free and without <br>
using junk food, lean goat for slaughters. Besides, producing goat milk also.

<h2>POULTRY</h2>
<pre>
One hundred and fifty “Kadaknath” Chicks of 65-75 days old were brought to our farm on<br>
7th July, and similarly like goat, started feeding non organic maize and other products<br>
as a feed. From September, onward we are able to provide organic maize and other products.<br>
Hence, our poultry is also semi organic fed. Use of antibiotic for feed is completely <br>
absent, even, during illness of chicks, only multivitamins were used. From December <br>
second week, egg laying started and now it is available for sell at our far.

<h2>BEE KEEPING</h2>
<pre>
Soon, we will initiate bee keeping and provide honey to the consumers.<br>
Our future plan is to provide organic vegetables, fruits and pulses to the people, and first<br>
attempt is to make a group of 50-60 family and full-fill their requirements in Ludhiana area <br>
and tricity of Chandigarh initially. A number of challenged was already overcome and now we<br>
have good command over the land and its produce. AS wheat and Rice have some adverse effects <br>
on our health due to its processing methods and use, hence, we are not much interested for <br>
these products. We will try to popularize millet in place of rice and wheat.
